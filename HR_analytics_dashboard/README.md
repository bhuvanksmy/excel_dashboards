# HR Data Analytics Portfolio - Microsoft Excel

# Project Introduction: 
In the rapidly evolving business environment, effective HR management plays a critical role in organizational success. My HR Data Analytics portfolio project aims to provide insights into key HR metrics, facilitating informed decision-making for HR teams. The project focuses on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- Total Employees Count: Understanding the workforce size.
- Attrition Rate & Count: Monitoring the rate at which employees leave the organization.
- Active Employees: Tracking the number of currently active employees.
- Average Age: Analyzing the age distribution within the workforce.

This project delves into several critical areas, including total employees by gender, education-wise attrition, attrition by age, department-wise attrition, attrition by age group, and attrition by marital status. Additionally, interactive slicers for gender, education, and department have been incorporated to enhance data exploration and visualization.
